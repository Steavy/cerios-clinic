# Development Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the Clinic application for **local development** from scratch on a brand-new Windows machine. No prior experience with the tools is assumed.

> **Just want to run and test the app?** See [README.md](README.md) for the Docker-only quick start — no Node.js or other tools required.

---

## Prerequisites

Install the following tools **in order**. Each link goes to the official download page.

### Node.js (v24 LTS)

1. Go to https://nodejs.org and download the **LTS** version (24.x).
2. Run the installer. Accept all defaults.
3. Open a new terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and verify:

```bash
node --version
# Should show v24.x.x

npm --version
# Should show 11.x.x
```

> The repo pins the Node major version in `.nvmrc` / `.node-version` and in `package.json` `engines`. Any Node 24 patch release is fine for local development.

### pnpm (Package Manager)

This project uses `pnpm` instead of `npm` because it is faster and shares packages across workspaces. The exact pnpm version is pinned in `package.json` via `packageManager`, so the easiest setup is **Corepack** (ships with Node 24):

```bash
corepack enable
```

The first time you run `pnpm` in this repo, Corepack will install the pinned version automatically. Verify:

```bash
pnpm --version
# Should match the version in package.json "packageManager"
```

### Docker Desktop

1. Go to https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ and download **Docker Desktop for Windows**.
2. Run the installer. Accept all defaults.
3. After installation, **restart your computer**.
4. Open Docker Desktop and wait until it shows **"Docker Desktop is running"** (the whale icon in the system tray is steady).
5. Verify in a terminal:

```bash
docker --version
# Should show Docker version 25.x.x or higher

docker compose version
# Should show Docker Compose version v2.x.x
```

> **Note for Windows Home users:** Docker Desktop requires WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). The installer will prompt you to enable it automatically. Follow those prompts if they appear, then restart when asked.

### Git

1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and download the installer.
2. Run it and accept all defaults.
3. Verify:

```bash
git --version
# Should show git version 2.x.x
```

---

## Step 1 — Get the Code

Open a terminal, navigate to where you want to store the project, then clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url> clinic-monorepo
cd clinic-monorepo
```

> Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual Git URL provided to you.

---

## Step 2 — Create the Environment File

The project needs a `.env` file with configuration values. The example file contains sensible defaults for local development — just copy it:

**On Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

**On Mac/Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

No changes are needed — the defaults work out of the box for local development.

---

## Step 3 — Install Node Dependencies

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs packages for all apps and packages in the monorepo at once. It may take a few minutes the first time.

As part of the install, `prisma generate` runs automatically (via a `postinstall` hook) to generate the Prisma client types.

### Building packages for VS Code IntelliSense

The NestJS apps resolve shared packages via their compiled output (`dist/`). Run this once after a fresh clone so the TypeScript language service in VS Code works correctly:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This builds packages first, then apps — in the correct order. It is also used for production builds.

> This is only needed for IDE type-checking. `pnpm run dev` works correctly without it.

---

## Step 4 — Start the Infrastructure (Docker)

This starts PostgreSQL, Keycloak, and Mailpit inside Docker containers.

```bash
pnpm run infra:up
```

You should see output like:

```
✔ Container clinic-postgres   Started
✔ Container clinic-keycloak   Started
✔ Container clinic-mailpit    Started
```

### Wait for Keycloak to be ready

Keycloak takes about **60–120 seconds** to start the very first time because it imports the realm configuration and sets up its database tables.

Check that it is ready by opening http://localhost:8180 in a browser. You should see the Keycloak welcome page.

Alternatively, check the container status:

```bash
docker ps
# Look for clinic-keycloak — the STATUS column should show "healthy"
```

> **If Keycloak never becomes healthy:** Check the logs with `docker logs clinic-keycloak --tail 50`. A common cause is that the database was not yet ready when Keycloak tried to connect. Run `pnpm run infra:down` and then `pnpm run infra:up` again to restart everything cleanly.

---

## Step 5 — Run Database Migrations

This creates all the tables in PostgreSQL:

```bash
pnpm run db:migrate
```

On a fresh clone this applies all existing migrations automatically without any prompts.

> If the tables already exist from a previous run you can skip this step.

> **Note:** `db:migrate` uses `prisma migrate dev`, which is **interactive** — it will prompt you to name a new migration if one is detected. To apply existing migration files non-interactively (e.g. in CI or when deploying to a shared environment), use:
>
> ```bash
> pnpm run db:migrate:deploy
> ```

---

## Step 6 — Seed the Database

This creates all the test users in both PostgreSQL and Keycloak:

```bash
pnpm run db:seed
```

The seed script creates the following accounts. Staff accounts use the password set in `SEED_STAFF_PASSWORD` (e.g., `Clinic1234!`). Patient accounts use the password set in `SEED_PATIENT_PASSWORD` (e.g., `Patient1234!`).

#### Doctors — log in at http://localhost:5174

| Email                      | Name             | Specialty        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `dr.smith@clinic.local`    | James Smith      | General Practice |
| `dr.johnson@clinic.local`  | Sarah Johnson    | Cardiology       |
| `dr.williams@clinic.local` | Michael Williams | Neurology        |

#### Assistants — log in at http://localhost:5175

| Email                           | Name         | Department      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| `assistant.brown@clinic.local`  | Emily Brown  | Reception       |
| `assistant.davis@clinic.local`  | Robert Davis | Cardiology Wing |
| `assistant.miller@clinic.local` | Lisa Miller  | Neurology Wing  |

#### Admin — log in at http://localhost:5176

| Email                | Name         | Role    |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| `admin@clinic.local` | System Admin | `admin` |

> The `admin@clinic.local` account's password is set in `KEYCLOAK_REALM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (default: `Admin1234!`), not in `SEED_STAFF_PASSWORD`.

#### Patients — log in at http://localhost:5173

| Email                          | Name           |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `patient.wilson@example.com`   | Alice Wilson   |
| `patient.moore@example.com`    | Bob Moore      |
| `patient.taylor@example.com`   | Carol Taylor   |
| `patient.anderson@example.com` | David Anderson |
| `patient.thomas@example.com`   | Eva Thomas     |

> Patient accounts use the password set in `SEED_PATIENT_PASSWORD` (default: `Patient1234!`). They can be used with `api-service-client` direct grant to test the Patient API.

### Resetting the database

To wipe all data and start fresh, run these three commands in order:

```bash
pnpm run db:reset    # ⚠ Drops and recreates the database — all data is lost
pnpm run db:migrate  # Re-applies all migrations to recreate the tables
pnpm run db:seed     # Re-creates all test users in PostgreSQL and Keycloak
```

> `db:reset` only affects PostgreSQL. If Keycloak already has the seed users from a previous run, `db:seed` may fail with "user already exists". In that case, delete the conflicting users in the [Keycloak admin console](http://localhost:8180) first, or re-run `pnpm run infra:down && pnpm run infra:up` to reset Keycloak as well (this wipes its database too).

---

## Step 7 — Start the Web Application

Start all six web services (3 APIs + 3 frontends) with a single command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Each service is colour-coded in the terminal output. You can now open:

- **Patient Portal** → http://localhost:5173
- **Doctor Portal** → http://localhost:5174
- **Assistant Portal** → http://localhost:5175

Press `Ctrl + C` to stop all services.

---

## Step 8 — Test the Native Android App (Patient Mobile, Release APK)

The patient mobile app is a React Native app that connects to the same local APIs and Keycloak as the web portals. This guide uses a **release APK flow for testing** (no Metro/dev server required).

### 8.1 — Prerequisites

Before running the app you need the Android development toolchain. If you have **Android Studio** installed this is already taken care of. For a minimal command-line-only setup:

1. **Java (JDK 17 or newer)** — Download from https://adoptium.net and install. JDK 17, 21, or 25 all work; the setup script in section 8.2 handles JDK compatibility with Gradle automatically. Verify:
   ```bash
   java -version
   # Should show your installed JDK version
   ```
2. **Android Studio** (recommended) — Download from https://developer.android.com/studio. During setup, make sure the following are installed via the SDK Manager:
   - Android SDK Platform (API 35 or higher)
   - Android SDK Build-Tools
   - Android Emulator
3. **ANDROID_HOME environment variable** — Android Studio sets this automatically. To verify:
   ```powershell
   echo $env:ANDROID_HOME
   # Should print a path like C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
   ```
   If it is blank, add it to your user environment variables and restart your terminal.

### 8.2 — Generate the Android Configuration File

Run the one-time setup script from the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm run mobile:setup
```

This script:

- Detects your Android SDK location (from `ANDROID_HOME` or common install paths) and writes `apps/patient-mobile/android/local.properties`.
- Checks your JDK version. If you have JDK 22 or newer (JDK 17–21 work natively with Gradle), it locates Android Studio's bundled JBR (Java 21) and adds `org.gradle.java.home` to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` so Gradle uses a compatible JDK automatically.

The generated `local.properties` file is git-ignored — each developer runs this once on their own machine. The `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` entry is written to your user home directory and also never touches version control.

> **Manual fallback — if the script cannot find your SDK:** Create `apps/patient-mobile/android/local.properties` by hand:
>
> ```properties
> # Windows example:
> sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
>
> # macOS example:
> # sdk.dir=/Users/<you>/Library/Android/sdk
> ```
>
> If you have JDK > 21 and the script cannot find Android Studio, add the following to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` (create the file if it does not exist):
>
> ```properties
> # Windows — path to Android Studio's bundled JBR:
> org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jbr
>
> # macOS:
> # org.gradle.java.home=/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home
> ```

### 8.3 — Configure the Environment File

The app reads API and Keycloak URLs from `apps/patient-mobile/.env`.

You can now generate this file automatically with a profile:

```bash
# Emulator profile (localhost on host machine via 10.0.2.2)
pnpm run mobile:env:emulator

# LAN profile (auto-detects your private IPv4)
pnpm run mobile:env:lan

# LAN profile with explicit IP override
pnpm run mobile:env:lan -- --ip=192.168.1.42
```

- Use `mobile:env:emulator` when testing on the built-in Android Emulator against local services on your machine.
- Use `mobile:env:lan` for physical devices (or emulator over Wi-Fi) on the same network.

Manual fallback (if you prefer editing `.env` yourself):

The app needs to know the IP address of your development machine so it can reach the APIs and Keycloak. A physical Android device cannot use `localhost` — it must use your machine's LAN IP address.

**Find your LAN IP:**

```powershell
ipconfig
# Look for the IPv4 address under your active network adapter, e.g. 192.168.1.42
```

Copy the example file and fill in your IP:

```powershell
Copy-Item apps/patient-mobile/.env.example apps/patient-mobile/.env
```

Then open `apps/patient-mobile/.env` and replace `LAN_IP` with your actual IP:

```env
API_URL=http://192.168.1.42:3001/api
KEYCLOAK_URL=http://192.168.1.42:8180
KEYCLOAK_REALM=clinic
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=patient-mobile-client
```

> **Android Emulator note:** If you are using the built-in Android Emulator (not a physical device), you can use `10.0.2.2` instead of your LAN IP — this is a special alias that the emulator maps to `localhost` on your host machine:
>
> ```env
> API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3001/api
> KEYCLOAK_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8180
> ```

### 8.4 — Set Up a Device or Emulator

**Option A — Android Emulator (no physical device needed)**

1. Open Android Studio.
2. Go to **More Actions → Virtual Device Manager** (or **Device Manager** in the toolbar).
3. Click **Create Device**, pick a phone (e.g. Pixel 8), choose a system image (API 35 / Android 15), and finish.
4. Click the **Play** button to start the emulator. Wait until it finishes booting to the home screen.

**Option B — Physical Android Device**

1. On the device: go to **Settings → About phone** and tap **Build number** seven times to enable Developer Options.
2. Go to **Settings → Developer Options** and enable **USB Debugging**.
3. Connect the device to your PC via USB.
4. Accept the "Allow USB debugging from this computer?" prompt on the device.
5. Verify the device is detected:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   # Should list your device, e.g.:
   # List of devices attached
   # R58MA1XXXXX   device
   ```

### 8.5 — Build and Install the Release App (No Metro)

Make sure the web services from Step 7 are already running (the APIs must be reachable from the device).

Use two terminals:

1. Terminal A: `pnpm run dev` (keep running)
2. Terminal B: mobile build/install commands below

From the monorepo root, run:

```bash
pnpm run mobile:test:emulator
```

This is the easiest localhost emulator flow. It does two things:

1. Generates `apps/patient-mobile/.env` with emulator-safe URLs (`10.0.2.2`)
2. Runs the full release testing flow

If you already have a custom `.env` profile selected, you can run:

```bash
pnpm run mobile:test
```

This command does the full release testing flow:

1. Generates Android local configuration (`mobile:setup`)
2. Installs mobile dependencies
3. Builds and installs a **release** APK on your connected emulator/device

For subsequent runs (faster), you can use:

```bash
pnpm run mobile:release:install
```

If you only want to generate the APK file without installing:

```bash
pnpm run mobile:release
```

The generated APK is at:

```text
apps/patient-mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

In Android Studio, open `apps/patient-mobile/android` and run the `app` module with the `release` variant.

### 8.6 — Log In to the Mobile App

The first build takes 2–5 minutes. Subsequent builds are much faster because Gradle caches the results.

> **If Android Studio is open** while running this command, make sure no Gradle sync or build is in progress in the IDE — concurrent Gradle processes can conflict.

Once the app is open:

1. Tap **Sign in with Clinic Account**.
2. The app opens the Keycloak login page in the device browser.
3. Log in with any patient account from the seed data, for example:
   - **Email:** `patient.wilson@example.com`
   - **Password:** `Patient1234!` (or the value of `SEED_PATIENT_PASSWORD` in your `.env`)
4. After login, Keycloak redirects back to the app automatically.

## Swagger / API Documentation

Each API has built-in Swagger UI for exploring endpoints:

| API           | Swagger URL                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Patient API   | http://localhost:3001/api/docs |
| Doctor API    | http://localhost:3002/api/docs |
| Assistant API | http://localhost:3003/api/docs |

To test authenticated endpoints in Swagger you need a Bearer token — see the next section.

---

## Getting a Bearer Token for API Testing

All three APIs are protected by Keycloak-issued JWT tokens. To call protected endpoints (e.g. from Swagger, Postman, or curl) you need to obtain a token first.

The easiest method for API testing is the **Resource Owner Password Credentials** (direct grant) flow against the `api-service-client`.

> **Note:** The staff portals (`staff-portal-client`) and patient portal (`patient-portal-client`) are configured as public PKCE clients and **do not support** the direct grant flow. Use `api-service-client` for programmatic token requests.

### Option A — Using curl

Open a terminal and run the following command. Replace `<email>` and `<password>` with a valid test account:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8180/realms/clinic/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -d "client_id=api-service-client" \
  -d "client_secret=api_service_secret_change_in_prod" \
  -d "username=dr.smith@clinic.local" \
  -d "password=Staff1234!" \
  -d "scope=openid"
```

For a patient token, use a patient account and `SEED_PATIENT_PASSWORD`:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8180/realms/clinic/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=password" \
  -d "client_id=api-service-client" \
  -d "client_secret=api_service_secret_change_in_prod" \
  -d "username=patient.wilson@example.com" \
  -d "password=Patient1234!" \
  -d "scope=openid"
```

The response is a JSON object. Copy the `access_token` value — it is the Bearer token.

**Example response (truncated):**

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...",
  "expires_in": 300,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  ...
}
```

> **Windows PowerShell alternative** (no curl installed):
>
> ```powershell
> $body = @{
>     grant_type    = "password"
>     client_id     = "api-service-client"
>     client_secret = "api_service_secret_change_in_prod"
>     username      = "dr.smith@clinic.local"
>     password      = "Staff1234!"
>     scope         = "openid"
> }
> $r = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
>     -Uri "http://localhost:8180/realms/clinic/protocol/openid-connect/token" `
>     -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" `
>     -Body $body
> $r.access_token
> ```
>
> For a patient token, swap the username/password:
>
> ```powershell
> $body = @{
>     grant_type    = "password"
>     client_id     = "api-service-client"
>     client_secret = "api_service_secret_change_in_prod"
>     username      = "patient.wilson@example.com"
>     password      = "Patient1234!"
>     scope         = "openid"
> }
> $r = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
>     -Uri "http://localhost:8180/realms/clinic/protocol/openid-connect/token" `
>     -ContentType "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" `
>     -Body $body
> $r.access_token
> ```

### Option B — Using Postman

1. Open Postman and create a new **POST** request.
2. Set the URL to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8180/realms/clinic/protocol/openid-connect/token
   ```
3. Under the **Body** tab, select **x-www-form-urlencoded** and add these key/value pairs:

| Key             | Value                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `grant_type`    | `password`                          |
| `client_id`     | `api-service-client`                |
| `client_secret` | `api_service_secret_change_in_prod` |
| `username`      | `dr.smith@clinic.local`             |
| `password`      | `Staff1234!`                        |
| `scope`         | `openid`                            |

4. Click **Send**. Copy the `access_token` from the response.

### Option C — Using Swagger UI

1. Get a token using Option A or B above.
2. Open Swagger (e.g., http://localhost:3002/api/docs for the Doctor API).
3. Click the **Authorize** button (padlock icon, top right).
4. Paste the token into the **Value** field (no need to type "Bearer " — Swagger adds it automatically).
5. Click **Authorize**, then **Close**.
6. All subsequent requests from Swagger will include the token automatically.

### Which Token to Use for Which API?

A token embeds the user's roles. The APIs enforce the following:

| API                     | Required Role          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Patient API (`:3001`)   | `patient`              |
| Doctor API (`:3002`)    | `doctor` or `admin`    |
| Assistant API (`:3003`) | `assistant` or `admin` |

Use an account that has the right role:

- **Patient endpoints** → use `patient.wilson@example.com` (role: `patient`, password: `SEED_PATIENT_PASSWORD`)
- **Doctor endpoints** → use `dr.smith@clinic.local` (role: `doctor`)
- **Assistant endpoints** → use `assistant.brown@clinic.local` (role: `assistant`)
- **Admin endpoints** → use `admin@clinic.local` (role: `admin`, password: `KEYCLOAK_REALM_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

Tokens are valid for **5 minutes** by default. Request a new one when it expires.

---

## Keycloak Admin Console

To manage users, roles, and clients directly:

1. Open http://localhost:8180
2. Click **Administration Console**
3. Log in with:
   - **Username:** `admin` (or the value of `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER` in your `.env`)
   - **Password:** `admin_secret` (or the value of `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env`)
4. Select the **clinic** realm from the dropdown in the top-left corner.

---

## Mailpit (Email Catcher)

All emails sent by the application (password resets, etc.) are captured locally by Mailpit. No real emails are sent.

Open http://localhost:8025 to view the inbox.

### Patient self-registration with email verification (test walkthrough)

Patient self-registration creates an unverified Keycloak user and sends a verification email through Mailpit. Login is blocked until the user clicks the link.

1. Ensure the stack is running from a clean install so the updated realm import and service-account permissions are applied: `pnpm run docker:reset`.
2. Open the patient portal at http://localhost:5173 and click **Create account**.
3. Fill in the form and submit. The portal confirms the account was created and points you to your inbox.
4. Open Mailpit at http://localhost:8025. A **"Verify email"** message from `noreply@clinic.local` should appear within a few seconds.
5. Click the **Link to e-mail address verification** link in the message. Keycloak completes verification and redirects back to the portal.
6. Sign in from the portal using the email and password you registered with. Login should now succeed.
7. (Optional) To exercise the resend flow, register a second account and click **Resend verification email** on the success panel before clicking the first link. A new verification email appears in Mailpit. The resend endpoint is throttled to one request per minute per email and returns `204` regardless of whether the email exists, to avoid enumeration.

If login fails with "Email not verified", return to Mailpit and click the verification link first. If no email arrives, check `docker logs clinic-api-patient` for a `[send verification email]` error line — this is the only place the real Keycloak response is surfaced.

## Troubleshooting

### "pnpm: command not found"

You need to install pnpm. Run `npm install -g pnpm` and open a new terminal window.

### "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"

Docker Desktop is not running. Open Docker Desktop from the Start Menu and wait for it to fully start before retrying.

### Keycloak never becomes healthy / stays "starting"

- Run `docker logs clinic-keycloak --tail 50` to see what is wrong.
- The most common cause is a timing issue. Run `pnpm run infra:down` then `pnpm run infra:up` and wait 2 minutes.

### "Database connection refused" or Prisma errors

- Make sure the Docker containers are running: `docker ps`
- Make sure the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file matches the `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` values.

### Token request fails with "401 Unauthorized" or "invalid_client"

- Double-check that `client_secret` in your token request matches `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env` and `api_service_secret_change_in_prod` in `infra/keycloak/clinic-realm.json`.
- Make sure you are targeting the `api-service-client` and not `patient-portal-client` or `staff-portal-client` (those do not support direct grant).

### Port already in use

The `pnpm run dev` command automatically kills processes on ports 3001, 3002, 3003, 5173, 5174, and 5175 before starting. If that fails, you can free them manually:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell — find and kill a process on port 3001
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3001).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Seeding fails with "user already exists"

The seed script is idempotent for the database but may fail if Keycloak already has the user. Either re-run after a fresh `db:reset`, or delete the conflicting user in the Keycloak admin console first.
