# Patient Mobile App (Android)

The patient mobile app is a React Native Android app. **The backend services must be running first** (see the [Quick Start](README.md#quick-start-pre-built-images--no-clone-needed) section in the README).

---

## Download the pre-built APK

If you just want to install the app without building it yourself:

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/CeriosTesting/cerios-clinic/releases) and download the latest `cerios-patient-mobile-*.apk`.
2. Transfer the APK to your Android device (e.g. via USB, email, or cloud storage).
3. On the device, open the APK file and allow installation from unknown sources when prompted.
4. Open the **Cerios Patient** app and sign in (see [Test Accounts](README.md#test-accounts)).

> The APK is configured for the Android emulator by default (`10.0.2.2` as the host address). To use it on a physical device, the backend must be reachable from the device's network — this requires building from source with the LAN profile (see below).

---

## Building from source

Follow the steps below if you need a custom build (e.g. for a physical device on your network).

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 24** and **pnpm** — See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for installation.
   The exact pnpm version is pinned via `package.json` `packageManager`, so the easiest setup is **Corepack** (ships with Node 24):
   ```bash
   corepack enable
   ```
2. **Java (JDK 17 or newer)** — Download from https://adoptium.net. JDK 17, 21, or 25 all work. Verify:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
3. **Android Studio** — Download from https://developer.android.com/studio. During setup, install the following via **SDK Manager** (Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Android SDK):
   - Android SDK Platform (API 35 or higher)
   - Android SDK Build-Tools
   - Android Emulator
4. **ANDROID_HOME environment variable** — Android Studio sets this automatically. Verify:
   ```powershell
   echo $env:ANDROID_HOME
   # Should print something like C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
   ```
   If it is blank, add it to your user environment variables and restart your terminal.

### Step 1 — Install dependencies

From the monorepo root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 2 — Generate Android configuration

```bash
pnpm run mobile:setup
```

This detects your Android SDK and writes `apps/patient-mobile/android/local.properties`. It also patches Gradle's JDK config if your system JDK is newer than 21.

### Step 3 — Configure environment

Choose the profile that matches your setup:

**Emulator (recommended for testers):**

```bash
pnpm run mobile:env:emulator
```

This generates `apps/patient-mobile/.env` with `10.0.2.2` addresses (the emulator's alias for your host machine).

**Physical device on the same network:**

```bash
pnpm run mobile:env:lan
```

This auto-detects your LAN IP. To specify an IP manually:

```bash
pnpm run mobile:env:lan -- --ip=192.168.1.42
```

### Step 4 — Set up an emulator or device

**Option A — Android Emulator (no physical device needed)**

1. Open Android Studio.
2. Go to **More Actions → Virtual Device Manager** (or **Device Manager** in the toolbar).
3. Click **Create Device**, pick a phone (e.g. Pixel 8), choose a system image (API 35 / Android 15), and finish.
4. Click the **Play** button to start the emulator. Wait until it boots to the home screen.

**Option B — Physical Android Device**

1. On the device: go to **Settings → About phone** and tap **Build number** seven times to enable Developer Options.
2. Go to **Settings → Developer Options** and enable **USB Debugging**.
3. Connect the device to your PC via USB and accept the debugging prompt.
4. Verify the device is detected:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

### Step 5 — Build and install

Make sure Docker services are running, then from the monorepo root:

**One-command emulator flow (steps 2–3 included):**

```bash
pnpm run mobile:test:emulator
```

**Or, if you already ran steps 2–3 manually:**

```bash
pnpm run mobile:release:install
```

The first build takes 2–5 minutes. Subsequent builds are much faster (Gradle caches results).

> **Tip:** If Android Studio is open, make sure no Gradle sync or build is running in the IDE — concurrent Gradle processes can conflict.

### Step 6 — Build and run from Android Studio (alternative)

Instead of using the command line, you can build directly from Android Studio:

1. Open Android Studio and select **Open** → navigate to `apps/patient-mobile/android` → click **OK**.
2. Wait for Gradle sync to finish (this may take a minute on first open).
3. In the toolbar, select your emulator or device from the device dropdown.
4. Open **Build → Select Build Variant** and choose **release** for the `:app` module.
5. Click the **Run ▶** button (or press `Shift+F10`).

### Step 7 — Log in to the app

1. Tap **Sign in with Clinic Account**.
2. The Keycloak login page opens in the device browser.
3. Log in with a patient account:
   - **Email:** `patient.wilson@example.com`
   - **Password:** `Patient1234!`
4. After login, Keycloak redirects back to the app automatically.

All patient test accounts are listed in the [Test Accounts](README.md#test-accounts) section in the README.

## Rebuilding after code changes

```bash
pnpm run mobile:release:install
```

To do a clean rebuild (if you hit build errors):

```bash
pnpm run mobile:release:clean
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                         | Solution                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SDK location not found`        | Run `pnpm run mobile:setup` or create `apps/patient-mobile/android/local.properties` manually                          |
| CMake errors with stale cache   | Delete `apps/patient-mobile/android/app/.cxx`, `app/build`, and `android/build` folders, then rebuild                  |
| `adb devices` shows nothing     | Check USB cable, enable USB Debugging on device, or start the emulator                                                 |
| App cannot reach API / Keycloak | Verify Docker services are running and `.env` has the correct IP (`10.0.2.2` for emulator, LAN IP for physical device) |
| Concurrent Gradle build error   | Close Android Studio or wait for its build to finish before running CLI builds                                         |
